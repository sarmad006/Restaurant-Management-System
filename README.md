## About Project

* ### Features

1. Order Monitoring

Well order is the most basic feature in the restaurant management system. We have implemented order monitor interface that would help our administrator or management team to monitor the order and only they can have the access to monitor the order. Since order could be take away or dine-in, our interface have been designed in that way that it would support both kinds of order. The administrator can view both kinds of orders and can update them.

2. Finance Monitoring

Finance Monitoring is important for running a restaurant management system. It would help administrator to go through the expense and revenue of the past months and on the basis of those administrator could change his business policy. After every order added to the system there would be change of revenue and expense in the that month analysis. On the basis of the result of expenses and revenue the system analysis will also show a pictorial description of loss or profit.

3. Complain Monitoring

To know about your user feedback and reviews is importance for an organization to run. We have provided an interface that would help administrator or management team to monitor the complaint. It would help our organization to grow and develop. Once the customer launches a complain it would be seen on the administrator interface in immediate time

4. Table Reservation

In our Restaurant Management System, we have provided a book table functionality in order to provide administrator the knowledge about the tables that are currently reserved or non-reserved. If customer requests for a table, then administrator will look for the unreserved tables and if there is none it would apologize the customer otherwise, they will assign the customer table.
